                Born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, Joe Nguyen is a 22-year-old  student. Growing up, Joe primarily was schooled privately, until high school when he would end up
                going to Millard South High School. In high school, Joe found interest in sports and video games. He would join the soccer team his freshman year and play varsity
                his junior and senior years. Joe was a straight-A student who found an interest in becoming a doctor. After high school, Joe decided to attend the University of
                Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and pursue a major in neuroscience. Now in his final semester, Joe has decided to move out and rent out a house with me and another friend.
                Joe has a plan to take a year off after graduating to study for the MKAT, and also ultimately decide if this is something he is okay with going to school for another 
                four years. He also wants to use this year to learn day trading to see if he can make a career out of it instead. In his free time, Joe spends most of his time studying or 
                playing video games on the weekdays. On the weekends, Joe likes to hang out with friends and watch TV Shows or Movies. This summer, Joe hopes to go to Vietnam for vacation, as 
                that is where his family is from. One of his favorite things he has ever done is when he went back to Vietnam after graduating high school. He ended up staying there for a month
                 and says it was great to see all of his family that still live there.
