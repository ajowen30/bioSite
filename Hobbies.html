                    In his free time, Joe likes to spend his time fishing. Now that he has moved, he lives near a lake that he plans to go to daily to fish.
                    He pointed out that he hasn't gone in a year due to school and work taking a lot of his summer away. Once it starts to get a bit warmer (probably in the
                    spring), Joe plans on really getting back out there as soon as possible. He also decided that his method of transport will be by Go Kart, as he has been
                    planning on getting one specifically for hauling and driving over to the lake.

                    On cold days or late nights not being spent with friends, Joe enjoys playing online games with his friends. How Joe and I originally met, was through a 
                    mutual friend by playing League of Legends together. This is a game Joe and I both still play to this day, along with other multiplayer online games. The
                    reason he likes gaming so much isn't necessarily for the competitive aspect, but it provides him a way to hangout and talk with his friends when they are 
                    unable to hangout in person.
